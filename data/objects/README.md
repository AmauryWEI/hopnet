# Kubric Objects

The data files for each object have been downloaded from:
`https://storage.googleapis.com/kubric-public/assets/KuBasic/<object_name>.tar.gz`.

The physical simulations are computed with `collision_geometry.obj` files, which are
simplified / coarser meshes compared to the `visual_geometry.obj`, used to generate the
MP4 videos of each dataset sample.
